The **Modularity Maturity Index (MMI)** is a metric used to evaluate the quality of a software system based on its level of modularity. Developed by **Workplace Solutions (WPS)**, the MMI provides a data-driven foundation for transforming monolithic or poorly structured systems into modular, maintainable architectures. Modularity is a key factor for ensuring long-term maintainability, scalability, and cost-efficiency in software development.

Carola Lilienthal, a leading expert at WPS, introduces the MMI in her [talk on domain patterns](/posts/li24-how_the_domain_influences_the_architecture) and in the company’s [podcast](https://www.wps.de/en/wps/computing-time/software-architecture-assessment-with-the-help-of-metrics--1).

## What is the Modularity Maturity Index?

The MMI measures the **modularity and structural quality** of a system and evaluates how well it adheres to modern software architecture principles. The scale ranges from **0 to 10**, where:
- **8–10**: Excellent systems with clear modularity, loose coupling, and well-defined layers.
- **4–8**: Moderate systems with room for improvement, often requiring targeted refactoring.
- **< 4**: Systems with unclear structure and high coupling, often referred to as "Big Ball of Mud" architectures.

## How is the MMI Calculated?

The MMI is calculated based on the following indicators:
1. **Coupling between components**: How many dependencies exist between modules? Are they cyclic?
2. **Hierarchy of components**: Does the architecture follow a clear layered model?
3. **Use of software patterns**: Are established patterns, such as Value Objects or layered architecture, employed?

The result is supported by tools like **Structure101**, **TeamScale**, **Sonargraph**, or **Lattix**, which help analyze dependency graphs, identify cyclic dependencies, and enforce architectural rules.

## Practical Example: Transformation with the MMI

The MMI serves as a foundation for planning and implementing architecture transformations. Carola Lilienthal outlines two typical scenarios in her [talk](/posts/li24-how_the_domain_influences_the_architecture):

### 1. Big Ball of Mud (MMI < 4)

A "Big Ball of Mud" is a chaotic system with high coupling and little to no modularity. Key steps include:
- **Technical Stabilization**:
  - Automating build and test processes.
  - Updating frameworks and libraries.
  - Introducing error resilience through logging and monitoring.
- **Tactical Domain-Driven Transformation**:
  - Identifying domains and introducing clear models.
  - Resolving cyclic dependencies.
  - Using Value Objects for data encapsulation.
  - Reducing inheritance and introducing Design-by-Contract principles.

### 2. Layered System (MMI 4–8)

Layered systems often exhibit some degree of modularity but suffer from oversized domain models or unclear boundaries. Two transformation paths are available:
- **Path 1: Tactical before Strategic Transformation**
  - Suitable for systems with large, complex classes in central modules.
  - Goal: Optimize domain logic first, then strategically improve architecture.
- **Path 2: Strategic before Tactical Transformation**
  - For systems with good domain separation and minimal dependencies.
  - Goal: Modularize the architecture strategically, followed by detail-level optimizations.

## Tools for MMI Evaluation

Calculating the MMI and transforming architectures are supported by specialized tools. Examples include:

- **[Structure101](https://www.sonarsource.com/structure101/)**: Visualizes complex dependency graphs and helps eliminate cyclic dependencies.
- **[TeamScale](https://teamscale.com/)**: Monitors adherence to architectural rules and detects violations early.
- **[Sonargraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph)**: Provides detailed analysis of coupling and layering.
- **[Lattix](https://www.lattix.com/)**: Facilitates continuous architectural improvement through metric-based visualizations.

## Conclusion

The Modularity Maturity Index (MMI) is a valuable tool for evaluating and transforming software architectures. By combining measurable indicators with automated tools, it enables architects and development teams to take targeted actions to improve modularity. As Mark Richards aptly states:

> **"Demonstration defeats discussion."**

Using tools to visualize metrics like the MMI allows teams to ground architectural decisions on objective, measurable foundations, making discussions more productive and decisions more impactful.
