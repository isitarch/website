Chelsea Troy explains the challenges of decision-making and the benefits of considering new (hidden) perspectives. Using examples, she delves into common thought patterns and presents proven strategies to improve decision alignment and make them more sustainable.

- Problem: Failure to consider perspectives as part of the context often leads to poor decisions
- "Generally" obscures edge cases and imposes limitations
- Differentiating between optimization and satisficing metrics is crucial
- Perspectives and identifying the relevant stakeholders are critical for decision-making
- Those affected by decisions, often hidden or marginalized groups, are a key source of insights for decision-making
- A clear distinction should be made between acceptable and preferred outcomes
