Dorra Bartaguiz explores the topic of tactical Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with clear and actionable rules for improving source code. She presents 9 fundamental principles that can directly enhance code quality. For each rule, she provides practical code examples and explains how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

[The 9 rules are based on a chapter by Jeff Bay from the book "The ThoughtWorks Anthology: Essays on Software Technology and Innovation"](/knowledge/tools/nine_rules_of_object_calisthenics).
