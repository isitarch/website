Mark Richard advocates for close collaboration between architects and developers. Using examples, he highlights problems that arise when software architecture and implementation are misaligned, emphasizing the need for operational, structural, and constraint-based architectural alignment. He introduces [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](/knowledge/tools/architecture-decision-records), fitness functions, and static analysis tools as aids.

- Problem: Architecture and implementation do not align -> poor software, e.g., non-performant systems
- Three types of architectural alignment as key to successful software architecture: alignment with operational properties, logical structure, or external constraints
- Tools for enforcing design decisions: fitness functions, ArchUnit, PyArch, ...
- Collaboration between architects and developers is essential for implementing design decisions
- [Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](/knowledge/tools/architecture-decision-records) are introduced as a tool for communication and documentation.
