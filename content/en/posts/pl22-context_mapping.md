Michael Plöd demonstrates how Context Mapping can be supported through the visualization of the Context Map and by using patterns. He establishes the connection between the Context Map, service dependencies, and team structures. As a supporting tool, Michael Plöd explains [10 patterns](/knowledge/patterns/collection_for_context_mapping) that can be helpful in Context Mapping.

The Context Map from Domain-Driven Design illustrates the relationships between different domains and their implementing systems. These systems can either be mutually dependent, have no influence on each other, or changes in one system (upstream) can lead to changes in another system (downstream), but not vice versa.

Beyond these technical dependencies, organizational dependencies are also addressed. What is the relationship between the development teams of the systems? Using examples, Michael Plöd frequently discusses issues related to these dependencies.
