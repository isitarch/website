Carola Lilienthal's motivation is the transformation of an existing system into a domain-driven system using Domain-Driven Transformation. She describes the transformation paths based on varying evaluations using the [Modularity Maturity Index (MMI)](/knowledge/metrics/modularity-maturity-index).

In doing so, she highlights why Domain-Driven Design is challenging to implement in some domains, sparking extensive discussions, while offering straightforward solutions for others. She identifies [three types of domains and describes their characteristics](/knowledge/patterns/collection_for_domain_types).
