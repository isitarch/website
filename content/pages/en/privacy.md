<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
<p>In the course of our business activities, we cooperate with various external entities. This sometimes necessitates the transfer of personal data to these external entities. Personal data is only shared with external entities if required for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., transfer to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in sharing the data under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When engaging processors, we share personal data based on a valid data processing agreement. In cases of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH ADVERTISING PURPOSES; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT ADVERTISING.

The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract delivered to you or a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

<ul>

<li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
<li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of processing instead of deletion.</li>
<li>If you have filed an objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the processing of your personal data has been restricted, this data may only be processed—with the exception of storage—with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
